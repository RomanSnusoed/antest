Based on the blood test results provided, here is an analysis and explanation:

1. Hemoglobin (Hb) - The hemoglobin level is 12.5 g/dl, which is slightly below the normal range of 13.0-17.0 g/dl. This indicates a low hemoglobin level, which can be indicative of anemia.

2. Total RBC Count - The total red blood cell count is 5.2 mill/cumm, within the normal range of 4.5-5.5 mill/cumm. This suggests that the number of red blood cells in the blood is adequate.

3. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) - The PCV value is 57.5%, which is higher than the normal range of 40-50%. This indicates an increased volume of red blood cells in the blood, which is consistent with the low hemoglobin level suggesting a concentration of red blood cells.

4. Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) - The MCV value is 87.75 fl, within the normal range of 83-101 fl. MCV measures the average volume of a red blood cell, and the result suggests that the size of the red blood cells is normal.

5. MCH and MCHC - Both the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) values are within normal ranges, indicating the average amount and concentration of hemoglobin in each red blood cell are normal.

6. RDW - The Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) value is 13.6%, within the normal range of 11.6-14.0%. RDW reflects the variation in the size of red blood cells. A normal RDW indicates that the red blood cells are relatively uniform in size.

7. Total WBC Count - The total white blood cell count is 9000 cumm, within the normal range of 4000-11000 cumm. This suggests a normal white blood cell count, indicating the body's ability to fight infection is satisfactory.

8. Differential WBC Count - The percentages of different types of white blood cells (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Eosinophils, Monocytes, Basophils) are all within their respective normal ranges, indicating a balanced immune response.

9. Platelet Count - The platelet count is within the normal range of 150000-410000 cumm, suggesting adequate blood clotting ability.

Overall, the blood test results indicate a low hemoglobin level, which suggests a possible anemia. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be needed to confirm the type and cause of anemia. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate management and treatment.
