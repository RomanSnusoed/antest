Based on the document, the medical findings include:

1. Brain MRI:
- Multiple T2 high signal foci in periventricular white matter and subcortical parts of the brain, consistent with a history of demyelination.
- No brain atrophy or black holes noted.
- No evidence of acute infarct seen in diffusion-weighted images.
- No abnormal enhancement seen after contrast injection.
- Normal position of the 4th ventricle with no midline shift or mass effect.
- Normal ventricular system and sulcal pattern.
- No acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage or significant extra-axial collections.
- Normal flow voids in internal carotid arteries and vertebrobasilar system.
- Normal basal ganglia, corpus callosum, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum, sella, pituitary gland, CPA areas, paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and orbital contents.

2. Cervical Spine MRI:
- Mild degenerative changes and reduced lordosis noted.
- Grossly normal vertebral bodies in marrow signal intensity and disc space height.
- No signal abnormality in spinal cord or visualized pre and paravertebral soft tissue.
- No evidence of canal stenosis.

These findings indicate that the patient has a history of demyelination affecting the brain, but overall, there are no acute abnormalities or significant structural issues identified in the brain or cervical spine. It is important for the patient to continue follow-up with their healthcare provider for monitoring and management of any underlying conditions.
